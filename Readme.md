---------------

```
  Here we go with
    * `mvn package && oc start-build hola --from-dir=. --follow`

  To check how that works
    * `curl -X GET http://hola-helloworld-msa-restat.192.168.99.100.nip.io/api/hola-chaining`

  Usable commands
    * `oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^hola | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'``
```
